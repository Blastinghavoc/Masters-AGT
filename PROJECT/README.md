This project was developed for one of my Masters modules, from a small engine provided by the course organisers.

The contents of the Engine folder are almost entirely written by the course organisers (I made a few small modifications), but the contents of the Game folder are my own (with the exception of the assets, which are free copyright-free assets obtained from various sources).
